# Documentation Index

Welcome to the Gem Miner technical documentation. This site is organized into three core pillars to separate current truths from historical context.

## :material-book-open-page-variant: Living Documentation

**The Source of Truth.** These documents reflect the *current* state of the project, architecture, and contracts. If the code changes, these docs must change.

### Architecture (DAMP)
- **[:material-map-legend: Overview](living/architecture/OVERVIEW.md)**: High-level structure and the "Four Pillars".
- **[:material-shield-star: The DAMP Strategy](living/architecture/DAMP.md)**: The "Explicit Contract" model and core philosophy.
- **[:material-blender-software: Blender API](living/architecture/BLENDER_API.md)**: How to write asset generation scripts.

### Guides
- **[:material-folder-open: Project Structure](living/guide/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)**: Overview of the codebase layout.
- **[:material-console: Taskfile Commands](living/guide/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md#key-workflows)**: How to build, run, and verify the project.

## :material-library-shelves: Knowledge Artifacts

**Context & History.** Tutorials, troubleshooting logs, and retrospective analysis. These documents capture knowledge at a point in time and may not reflect the latest code state.

### Troubleshooting
- **[:material-alert-circle: Common Errors](knowledge/troubleshooting/COMMON_ERRORS.md)**: Solutions for setup and runtime issues.
- **[:material-image-broken-variant: Graphics Troubleshooting](knowledge/troubleshooting/GRAPHICS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**: Fixing visual artifacts.

### Archives
- **[:material-history: History](knowledge/history/GEMINI_2025_12.md)**: Past session logs and decision records.
- **[:material-archive: Legacy Docs](knowledge/archive/ASSET_PIPELINE.md)**: Deprecated pipelines (OpenSCAD) and design documents.

## :material-clipboard-check: Task Tracking

**Planning & Execution.** The roadmap, active tasks, and work logs.

- **[:material-roadmap: Roadmap](planning/roadmap.md)**: High-level goals and backlog.
- **[:material-loading: Current Task](planning/task_scaling_rebalance.md)**: Status of the current active work.
