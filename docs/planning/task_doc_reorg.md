!!! abstract ":material-text-box-search-outline: Context"
    The documentation structure needs to be modernized to separate "Living" documentation (current truth) from "Knowledge Artifacts" (historical context). Additionally, we need to enforce a strict "Task Log" policy where all work is tracked.

!!! quote ":material-clipboard-list-outline: Plan"
    1.  **Restructure**: Reorganize `docs/` into `living`, `knowledge`, and `planning`.
    2.  **Rewrite Architecture**: Modernize architecture docs with DAMP "Explicit Contract" focus.
    3.  **Knowledge Management**: Add dates to historical artifacts and remove generic "archive" folders.
    4.  **Task Tracking**: Verify all current work has tasks and update the Roadmap.

!!! example ":material-console: Execution Log"
    -   [ ] **Structure**: Move files to `living/` and `knowledge/`.
    -   [ ] **Merge**: Sync with `main` to capture recent team updates.
    -   [ ] **Knowledge**: Add dates to artifact titles.
    -   [ ] **Roadmap**: Link this task in `roadmap.md`.
