!!! abstract ":material-text-box-search-outline: Context"
    The user identified that the project plan (`roadmap.md`) was pointing to an old/incorrect active task, and requested that guides be moved to a separate section dedicated to guides and tutorials. This task aims to correct the planning documentation and reorganize the site navigation.

!!! quote ":material-clipboard-list-outline: Plan"
    1.  **Update Planning Documents**
        *   Mark the old "Scaling Rebalance" task as Backlog (since it is Proposed but not active).
        *   Update `roadmap.md` to point to this new task.
        *   Update `mkdocs.yml` "Current Task" link.
    2.  **Restructure Documentation**
        *   Rename the "Guide" section in `mkdocs.yml` to "Guides & Tutorials" to provide the requested "separate section" visibility.
        *   Ensure the navigation structure is clean.
